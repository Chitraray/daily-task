<HR>DESCRIPTION:</HR>
<P>The second quarter of the year 2023 has been a mixed bag for Reliance Jio.
   While the <MARK>Mukesh Ambani</MARK>-owned company reported a net increase of 11.2 million subscribers for the second quarter of this financial year over the previous three-month period, 
   the underlying mobile average revenue per user (ARPU) growth slowed down.</P>


   <P><I> “ARPU has grown only 0.7% QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) despite one additional day in the quarter, 
     which implies underlying mobile ARPU should have slipped probably from unlimited 5G data – possibly impacting data recharges and some downgrades too,” 
     said brokerage <STRONG>ICICI Securities</STRONG> in a note.</I></P>


     <P>However, while the quarter-on-quarter ARPU growth has seen a drop for the company, the same has seen a growth year-on-year basis. 
     <U>Jio’s ARPU increased 2.5% to Rs 181.7, helped by strong growth in the fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) subscriber base which is estimated at about 45% year-on-year.</U> 
     The telecom operators <DEL>FTTH subscriber base stood at 10 million at the end of the quarter</DEL>, bringing in higher ARPU for the company than mobile subscribers.</P>
